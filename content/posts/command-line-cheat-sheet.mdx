title: Command Line Cheat Sheet
date: 2021-01-09

Everyday and obscure (yet helpful) commands and references I use when working in the command line. While I have some of these memorized, there are others I need reminding, and others I that have serious enough consequences I'd rather copy and paste (e.g. [Delete all folders, except [NAME]](#delete-all-folders-except-name)).

> *WARNING* I encourage you to research the utilties and arguments in a command before blindly executing them in a terminal.

> *NOTE* Commands tested in `zsh 5.8 (x86_64-apple-darwin20.0)` on `macOS 11.1 (20C69)`

## Bash Prompt Symbols
* `~` Current working directory is the current user’s home directory.
* `$` Current user is a standard user.
* `#` Current user is the root user

## Operators
* `>>` Append to file
* `>` output to something other than stdout (overwrite file)
* `|` feed output into another process
* `||` OR operator
* `&&`  AND operator

## Current shell
Get a rough idea of what commands are available in _remote_ shell instance.

```
$ echo $0
```

## Check exit code from previous command
Check if the process exited successfully without using something like logging.

```bash
$ [SOME_COMMAND]
$ echo $?
```

## Folder Size
Spot check the size of some output or see if the folder is a candidate for removal when cleaning up the file system.

```
$ du -sh [NAME]
```

## Truncate file
Useful when debugging or want a clean slate.

```
: > filename
```

## Pipe multi-line string (and remove all whitespace)
Remove the whitespace from a multi-line string and pipe to a specific utility. I use this with the [Readability CLI](https://github.com/ozbe/readability-cli) quite a bit.

```bash
$ cat <<EOF | tr -d "[:space:]" | [UTILITY]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Readability</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello, world!
    </body>
</html>
EOF
```

## Move files, including dot (hidden) files
Move _all_ the files.

*Enable glob support*
```
$ shopt -s dotglob
```

*Move files*
```
$ mv [SRC]/* [DESTINATION]/
```

## Delete all folders, except [NAME]
Clean up previous runs or logs except for the latest.

```
find . ! -name '[NAME]' -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## Make directory and move into it
[Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

```bash
$ mkdir [DIRECTORY] && cd $_
```

## Make intermediate directories
Make a new directory and any missing parent directories.

```bash
$ mkdir -p [DIRECTORY_WITH_SUBDIRECTORIES]
```

## Go back to previous directory
```bash
$ cd -
```

## File Stats
Get file stats, similar to `File` > `Get Info` in Finder.

```bash
$ stat [FILE]
```

## Get file chmod numerical Value (macOS)
Get the file chmod numerical value to compare to the value you're told to set it to.

```bash
$ stat -f “%OLp” [FILE]
```

## List all processes
List all processes to see what's running that shouldn't be?

```bash
$ ps -A
```

## Track process by port and kill said process
Port 8080 in use?! Find the process using the port and kill it.

```bash
# get process id
$ sudo lsof -i :[PORT]
# kill process
$ kill -9 [PID]
```

## Follow changes in a file
Output new lines in a file to the terminal.

```bash
$ tail -f [FILE]
```

## Copy set number of lines from the end of one file to another file
I only need a subset of the examples to run this test.

```bash
$ tail -n [NUM_LINES] [SRC_FILE] > [DEST_FILE]
```

## Command history to shell script
The most recent commands worked and it'd be nice to have them saved to be ran again.

```bash
$ tail -n [NUM_LINES_PLUS_ONE] ~/.zsh_history | head -n [NUM_LINES] > [FILE].sh
```

## Recursive grep
Search for text in directory and subdirectories.

```bash
$ grep -R ‘[SEARCH_TEXT]’
```

## List files to check with symlink
List files and output information about symlinks. Useful when trying to find the location of a file.

```bash
$ ls -al
```

## Output all file names
Output all file names (including those in subdirectories) and their relative path from the current working directory.

```bash
$ find .
```

## Output contents of file to clipboard (macOS)

```bash
$ cat [FILE] | pbcopy
```

## Paste to file (macOS)

```bash
$ pbpaste > [FILE]
```

## Extract tgz to a specific folder
Extract tgz to a specific folder instead of the current working directory.

```bash
tar zxvf [FILE].tgz -C [DESTINATION]
```

## Unzip with file wildcard
Unzip a collection of zip files in a folder.

```bash
$ unzip ‘[FILE_PREFIX]*.zip’
```

## Gunzip all files in a directory
```bash
$ for file in *.gz; do gunzip $file; done
```

## Get a list of name servers
```bash
$ dig NS [domain]
```

## Test name server
```bash
$ dig [domain] [@_NAME_SERVER]
```
