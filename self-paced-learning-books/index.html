Needless to say, not all of those books were as valuable as others and sometimes I read a book at the wrong time.  I want to share some of the books that were the most valuable and give some guidance to when I think one should read them.</p><p class="css-h0e33p">Early in my career I found myself over indexing on technical books. I spent a lot of time studying algorithms, design patterns, systems, and more. While these strengthened my understanding in these areas, they didn’t give me all the information I needed to be successful in my career. They didn’t help me contribute to making a successful product or help me build and maintain a healthy team. </p><p class="css-h0e33p">Later in my career I realized this imbalance and tried to correct for it. You should see this correction reflected in my recommendations below. I would encourage you, just as I have anyone I’ve had the opportunity to mentor or manage, to find a balance that works for you and your career aspirations.</p><p class="css-h0e33p"><strong class="css-0">NOTE</strong> While I may recommend reading a book framed around college, note that I don’t think you need to go to college to read any of these books college. Nor do I think you need to go to college to have a successful career in software. I merely use college a point of reference based on my personal experience.</p><h2 id="books" class="css-10cps2a"><a href="#books" aria-label="Books" class="css-1xo505e"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Books</h2><style data-emotion-css="1xlnz44">.css-1xlnz44{color:var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#000);font-family:inherit;line-height:1.125;font-weight:700;font-size:20px;}</style><style data-emotion-css="gi1g4g">.css-gi1g4g{pointer-events:painted;color:var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#000);font-family:inherit;line-height:1.125;font-weight:700;font-size:20px;}.css-gi1g4g a{visibility:hidden;}.css-gi1g4g:hover a{visibility:visible;}</style><h3 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-master" class="css-gi1g4g"><a href="#the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-master" aria-label="The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master" class="css-1xo505e"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</h3><p class="css-h0e33p"><style data-emotion-css="1qljzjn">.css-1qljzjn{color:var(--theme-ui-colors-primary,#07c);}</style><a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/" class="css-1qljzjn">The Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> | #Fundamentals</p><blockquote class="css-0"><p class="css-h0e33p">The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process—taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users.

The fact that the contributions are aligned around a single company’s goal is what makes it special. There are common themes, and common characters (software systems) that reappear in several chapters. We see choices from different perspectives, and know that they correlate to resolve competing interests. The articles are not rigorous, academic pieces; they are personal accounts, written with pride, in a variety of personal styles, and from the perspective of individual skill sets. They are written bravely, and with an intellectual honesty that is refreshing and uncommon in industry literature. Some claim “never do this, always do that,” others are more philosophical and tentative, reflecting the variety of personalities within an IT culture, and how that too plays a role in the story. We, in turn, read them with the humility of observers who were not part of the journey, and do not have all the information about the myriad conflicting challenges. Our many questions are the real legacy of the volume: Why didn’t they do <em class="css-0">X</em>? What if they’d done <em class="css-0">Y</em>? How will we look back on this in years to come? It is by comparing our own ideas to the reasoning here that we can measure our own thoughts and experiences.<br/>

Each chapter describes a different statistical technique, ranging from basic concepts like central tendency and describing distributions to more advanced concepts such as <em class="css-0">t</em> tests, regression, repeated measures ANOVA, and factor analysis. Each chapter begins with a short description of the statistic and when it should be used. This is followed by a more in-depth explanation of how the statistic works. Finally, each chapter ends with an example of the statistic in use, and a sample of how the results of analyses using the statistic might be written up for publication. A glossary of statistical terms and symbols is also included. Using the author’s own data and examples from published research and the popular media, the book is a straightforward and accessible guide to statistics.<br/>
